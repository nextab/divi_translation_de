# divi_translation_de
Proper German translation of the Divi WordPress theme translation files

# Installation (EN):
1) Use a Child Theme - if you don't know how to create one, use a plugin like https://de.wordpress.org/plugins/child-theme-generator/
2) Create a folder "lang" inside the directory of your child theme
3) Copy the files core-de_DE.mo and core-de_DE.po and paste them in your /lang folder (inside the Child Theme directory). Rename them to just "de_DE.po" and "de_DE.mo"
4) Create a folder "builder" inside the lang directory in your child theme (so it's located under /wp-content/themes/your-child-theme-folder/lang/builder)
5) Copy the files builder-de_DE.mo and builder-de_DE.po and paste them in your /builder folder. Rename them to just "de_DE.po" and "de_DE.mo".
6) Add the functions.php snippet to the functions.php in your child theme directory.
